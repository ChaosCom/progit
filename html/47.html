<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<h1 id="git_and_other_systems">Git and Other Systems</h1>

<p>The world isn’t perfect. Usually, you can’t immediately switch every project you come in contact with to Git. Sometimes you’re stuck on a project using another VCS, and many times that system is Subversion. You’ll spend the first part of this chapter learning about <code>git svn</code>, the bidirectional Subversion gateway tool in Git.</p>

<p>At some point, you may want to convert your existing project to Git. The second part of this chapter covers how to migrate your project into Git: first from Subversion, then from Perforce, and finally via a custom import script for a nonstandard importing case.</p>
