<h2 id="the_refspec">The Refspec</h2>

<p>Throughout this book, you’ve used simple mappings from remote branches to local references; but they can be more complex. Suppose you add a remote like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git</code></pre>

<p>It adds a section to your <code>.git/config</code> file, specifying the name of the remote (<code>origin</code>), the URL of the remote repository, and the refspec for fetching:</p>

<pre><code>[remote "origin"]
       url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code></pre>

<p>The format of the refspec is an optional <code>+</code>, followed by <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> is the pattern for references on the remote side and <code>&lt;dst&gt;</code> is where those references will be written locally. The <code>+</code> tells Git to update the reference even if it isn’t a fast-forward.</p>

<p>In the default case that is automatically written by a <code>git remote add</code> command, Git fetches all the references under <code>refs/heads/</code> on the server and writes them to <code>refs/remotes/origin/</code> locally. So, if there is a <code>master</code> branch on the server, you can access the log of that branch locally via</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master
$ git log remotes/origin/master
$ git log refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>

<p>They’re all equivalent, because Git expands each of them to <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</p>

<p>If you want Git instead to pull down only the <code>master</code> branch each time, and not every other branch on the remote server, you can change the fetch line to</p>

<pre><code>fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>

<p>This is just the default refspec for <code>git fetch</code> for that remote. If you want to do something one time, you can specify the refspec on the command line, too. To pull the <code>master</code> branch on the remote down to <code>origin/mymaster</code> locally, you can run</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster</code></pre>

<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs. On the command line, you can pull down several branches like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster \
   topic:refs/remotes/origin/topic
From git@github.com:schacon/simplegit
 ! [rejected]        master     -&gt; origin/mymaster  (non fast forward)
 * [new branch]      topic      -&gt; origin/topic</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the master branch pull was rejected because it wasn’t a fast-forward reference. You can override that by specifying the <code>+</code> in front of the refspec.</p>

<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs for fetching in your configuration file. If you want to always fetch the master and experiment branches, add two lines:</p>

<pre><code>[remote "origin"]
       url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
       fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
       fetch = +refs/heads/experiment:refs/remotes/origin/experiment</code></pre>

<p>You can’t use partial globs in the pattern, so this would be invalid:</p>

<pre><code>fetch = +refs/heads/qa*:refs/remotes/origin/qa*</code></pre>

<p>However, you can use namespacing to accomplish something like that. If you have a QA team that pushes a series of branches, and you want to get the master branch and any of the QA team’s branches but nothing else, you can use a config section like this:</p>

<pre><code>[remote "origin"]
       url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
       fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
       fetch = +refs/heads/qa/*:refs/remotes/origin/qa/*</code></pre>

<p>If you have a complex workflow process that has a QA team pushing branches, developers pushing branches, and integration teams pushing and collaborating on remote branches, you can namespace them easily this way.</p>

<h3 id="pushing_refspecs">Pushing Refspecs</h3>

<p>It’s nice that you can fetch namespaced references that way, but how does the QA team get their branches into a <code>qa/</code> namespace in the first place? You accomplish that by using refspecs to push.</p>

<p>If the QA team wants to push their <code>master</code> branch to <code>qa/master</code> on the remote server, they can run</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>

<p>If they want Git to do that automatically each time they run <code>git push origin</code>, they can add a <code>push</code> value to their config file:</p>

<pre><code>[remote "origin"]
       url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
       push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>

<p>Again, this will cause a <code>git push origin</code> to push the local <code>master</code> branch to the remote <code>qa/master</code> branch by default.</p>

<h3 id="deleting_references">Deleting References</h3>

<p>You can also use the refspec to delete references from the remote server by running something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin :topic</code></pre>

<p>Because the refspec is <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, by leaving off the <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> part, this basically says to make the topic branch on the remote nothing, which deletes it.</p>
