<h2 id="git_references">Git References</h2>

<p>You can run something like <code>git log 1a410e</code> to look through your whole history, but you still have to remember that <code>1a410e</code> is the last commit in order to walk that history to find all those objects. You need a file in which you can store the SHA-1 value under a simple name so you can use that pointer rather than the raw SHA-1 value.</p>

<p>In Git, these are called “references” or “refs”; you can find the files that contain the SHA-1 values in the <code>.git/refs</code> directory. In the current project, this directory contains no files, but it does contain a simple structure:</p>

<pre><code>$ find .git/refs
.git/refs
.git/refs/heads
.git/refs/tags
$ find .git/refs -type f
$</code></pre>

<p>To create a new reference that will help you remember where your latest commit is, you can technically do something as simple as this:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9" &gt; .git/refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can use the head reference you just created instead of the SHA-1 value in your Git commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=oneline  master
1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 third commit
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit</code></pre>

<p>You aren’t encouraged to directly edit the reference files. Git provides a safer command to do this if you want to update a reference called <code>update-ref</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/master 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9</code></pre>

<p>That’s basically what a branch in Git is: a simple pointer or reference to the head of a line of work. To create a branch back at the second commit, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/test cac0ca</code></pre>

<p>Your branch will contain only work from that commit down:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=oneline test
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit</code></pre>

<p>Now, your Git database conceptually looks something like Figure 9-4.</p>

<br> Figure 9-4. Git directory objects with branch head references included.

<p>When you run commands like <code>git branch (branchname)</code>, Git basically runs that <code>update-ref</code> command to add the SHA-1 of the last commit of the branch you’re on into whatever new reference you want to create.</p>

<h3 id="the_head">The HEAD</h3>

<p>The question now is, when you run <code>git branch (branchname)</code>, how does Git know the SHA-1 of the last commit? The answer is the HEAD file. The HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you’re currently on. By symbolic reference, I mean that unlike a normal reference, it doesn’t generally contain a SHA-1 value but rather a pointer to another reference. If you look at the file, you’ll normally see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>git checkout test</code>, Git updates the file to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/test</code></pre>

<p>When you run <code>git commit</code>, it creates the commit object, specifying the parent of that commit object to be whatever SHA-1 value the reference in HEAD points to.</p>

<p>You can also manually edit this file, but again a safer command exists to do so: <code>symbolic-ref</code>. You can read the value of your HEAD via this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git symbolic-ref HEAD
refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>You can also set the value of HEAD:</p>

<pre><code>$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/test
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/test</code></pre>

<p>You can’t set a symbolic reference outside of the refs style:</p>

<pre><code>$ git symbolic-ref HEAD test
fatal: Refusing to point HEAD outside of refs/</code></pre>

<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>

<p>You’ve just gone over Git’s three main object types, but there is a fourth. The tag object is very much like a commit object — it contains a tagger, a date, a message, and a pointer. The main difference is that a tag object points to a commit rather than a tree. It’s like a branch reference, but it never moves — it always points to the same commit but gives it a friendlier name.</p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 2, there are two types of tags: annotated and lightweight. You can make a lightweight tag by running something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0 cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d</code></pre>

<p>That is all a lightweight tag is — a branch that never moves. An annotated tag is more complex, however. If you create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit. You can see this by creating an annotated tag (<code>-a</code> specifies that it’s an annotated tag):</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -a v1.1 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 -m 'test tag'</code></pre>

<p>Here’s the object SHA-1 value it created:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/tags/v1.1 
9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2</code></pre>

<p>Now, run the <code>cat-file</code> command on that SHA-1 value:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p 9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2
object 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9
type commit
tag v1.1
tagger Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; Sat May 23 16:48:58 2009 -0700

test tag</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the object entry points to the commit SHA-1 value that you tagged. Also notice that it doesn’t need to point to a commit; you can tag any Git object. In the Git source code, for example, the maintainer has added their GPG public key as a blob object and then tagged it. You can view the public key by running</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file blob junio-gpg-pub</code></pre>

<p>in the Git source code repository. The Linux kernel repository also has a non-commit-pointing tag object — the first tag created points to the initial tree of the import of the source code.</p>

<h3 id="remotes">Remotes</h3>

<p>The third type of reference that you’ll see is a remote reference. If you add a remote and push to it, Git stores the value you last pushed to that remote for each branch in the <code>refs/remotes</code> directory. For instance, you can add a remote called <code>origin</code> and push your <code>master</code> branch to it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 11, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 716 bytes, done.
Total 7 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 1)
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
   a11bef0..ca82a6d  master -&gt; master</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can see what the <code>master</code> branch on the <code>origin</code> remote was the last time you communicated with the server, by checking the <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/master 
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949</code></pre>

<p>Remote references differ from branches (<code>refs/heads</code> references) mainly in that they can’t be checked out. Git moves them around as bookmarks to the last known state of where those branches were on those servers.</p>
